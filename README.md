# Reinforcement Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of Reinforcement Learning projects that I have worked on.

## Introduction

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that allows an agent to learn how to behave in an environment by trial and error. The agent receives rewards for taking actions that lead to desired outcomes, and penalties for taking actions that lead to undesired outcomes. Over time, the agent learns to take actions that maximize its rewards.

The projects in this repository explore a variety of Reinforcement Learning algorithms and techniques.
